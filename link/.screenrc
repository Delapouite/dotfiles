# SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION
# --------------------
# Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup.

startup_message off

# Sets whether screen will automatically detach upon hangup, which saves all your running 
# programs until they are resumed with a screen -r command. When turned off, a hangup 
# signal will terminate screen and all the processes it contains. Autodetach is on by 
# default.

autodetach on

# Same as the scrollback command except that the default setting for new windows is changed.

# TERMINAL CUSTOMIZATION
# ----------------------
# This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal’s hardstatus line. The first 
# form toggles whether screen will use the hardware status line to display messages. If the 
# flag is set to ‘off’, these messages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. 


#G Explanation of hardstatus line.
# Here is the full list of supported escapes:
#
#   %      the escape character itself
#
#   a      either 'am' or 'pm'
#   A      either 'AM' or 'PM'
#
#   c      current time HH:MM in 24h format
#   C      current time HH:MM in 12h format
#
#   y      last two digits of the year number
#   Y      full year number
#
#   d      day number
#   D      weekday name
#   m      month number
#   M      month name
#   s      seconds
#
#   f      flags of the window
#   F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus
#
#   h      hardstatus of the window
#   H      hostname of the system
#   l      current load of the system
#
#   n      window number
#   t      window title
#
#   u      all other users on this window
#
#   w      all window numbers and names. With '-'  quailifier:  up  to  the
#          current  window;  with  '+'  qualifier: starting with the window
#
#   W      all window numbers and names except the current one
# 
#   ?      the part to the next ’%?’ is displayed only if a ’%’ escape inside the part 
#          expands to a non-empty string
# 
#   :      else part of ’%?’
# 
#   =      pad the string to the display’s width (like TeX’s hfill). If a number is 
#          specified, pad to the percentage of the window’s width.  A ’0’ qualifier tells 
#          screen to treat  the  number  as  absolute position.  You can specify to pad 
#          relative to the last absolute pad position by adding a ’+’ qualifier or to pad 
#          relative to the right margin by using ’-’. The padding truncates the string if 
#          the specified position lies before the current position. 
# 
#          Add the ’L’ qualifier to change this.
# 
#   <      same as ’%=’ but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces
# 
#   >      mark the current text position for the next truncation. When screen needs to 
#          do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the marked position gets moved 
#          to the specified  percentage of the output area. (The area starts from the last 
#          absolute pad position and ends with the position specified by the truncation 
#          operator.)
#
#          The ’L’ qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated parts with ’...’.
# 
#   {      attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next "}"
#
# An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or the color settings. 
# Its format is "[attribute modifier] [color description]". The attribute  modifier must 
# be prefixed by a change type indicator if it can be confused with a color desciption. 
# The following change types are known:
# 
#   +      add the specified set to the current attributes
#   -      remove the set from the current attributes
#   =      change the current attributes to the specified set
# 
# The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a combination of 
# the following letters:
# 
#   u      underline
#   b      bold
# 
# Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying the desired 
# background and foreground color (in that order). The following colors are known:
# 
#   k      black
#   r      red
#   g      green
#   y      yellow
#   b      blue
#   m      magenta
#   c      cyan
#   w      white
#   d      default color
#   .      leave color unchanged
# 
# The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors.
